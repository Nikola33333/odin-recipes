        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>Sweeten things up with white sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter: </strong>You'll need a stick of melted butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>A tablespoon of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the pizzelle cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour: </strong>All-purpose flour creates structure in the cookie dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder: </strong>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise slightly.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Make sure to brush your pizzelle iron with vegetable oil to keep the cookies from sticking.</li>
        </ul>
